# Metacrafters-JS-Proof-Project
This NFT Minting Simulation project is a simple and interactive JavaScript application that emulates the creation and management of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). In this project, i will implement functions to mint new NFTs, list all the minted NFTs, and track the total supply of NFTs created.
