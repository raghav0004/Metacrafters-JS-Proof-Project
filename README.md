This NFT Minting Simulation project is a simple and interactive JavaScript application that emulates the creation and management of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). In this project, i will implement functions to mint new NFTs, list all the minted NFTs, and track the total supply of NFTs created.

Key Features:
1. Mint New NFTs: The mintNFT function allows users to create a new NFT with specific metadata such as name, eye color, shirt type, and bling. Each newly minted NFT is stored in an array and a confirmation message is displayed.
   
2.List All NFTs: The listNFTs function iterates through the array of NFTs and prints their metadata to the console. This function provides a clear and organized display of all the NFTs that have been created.

3. Total NFT Supply: The getTotalSupply function returns the total number of NFTs that have been minted. This gives users a quick overview of the total NFTs in the collection.
   
4.Project Structure: NFT Storage: An array named nfts is used to store all the NFT objects.

5.Minting Function: The mintNFT function creates and adds new NFT objects to the nfts array.

6.Listing Function: The listNFTs function prints each NFTâ€™s metadata to the console in a readable format.

7.Supply Function: The getTotalSupply function returns the number of NFTs stored in the array.

Conclusion: This project serves as an educational tool to understand the basic principles of NFT creation and management. It allows users to interact with the code by minting new NFTs, viewing their collection, and keeping track of the total supply. This simulation provides a foundational understanding of how NFTs function in a simplified environment.
